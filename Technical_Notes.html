      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The purpose of this 
        document is to provide an overview for the source code for Realpolitik. 
        I admit that it is not anywhere complete. I&#146;ll be working on it over 
        the next few months, and I am hoping that others can also contribute, 
        making a fuller picture of Realpolitik.</font></p>

      <p>History</p>
      </font></b> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Realpolitik began 
        as a Unix program, written to moderate games amongst my friends. While 
        the games ended (sorry Gus), I continued working on the program. Originally 
        I intended it to be a mail server, but gave that up after being introduced 
        to the Judge. However, seeing MapIt gave me the idea of giving it a graphical 
        interface and running it on the Macintosh. MacDip was born. I continued 
        working on MacDip for a few years until circumstances led me to pull it 
        from distribution. But after I saw other programs continue, I brought 
        MacDip back, in a new incarnation: Realpolitik. The following years saw 
        a port of Realpolitik to Windows, and then a cross platform version with 
        shared data files and common code. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This rather checkered 
        history has led to some rather checkered code. The oldest code is the 
        resolution code, and it has a definite vanilla C feel to it. There are 
        some #defines which act like C++ methods, but it's basically C. The newest 
        parts are the platform specific classes, which are fairly object-oriented, 
        but there are, admittedly, some hacks.</font></p>

      <b><font size=2 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
      <p>Initialization</p>
      </font></b> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Because Realpolitik 
        is a cross-platform application, initialization gets a little wonky. There 
        are certain platform-specific things that need to be done for initial 
        startup, then some common initialization routines are called. Finally, 
        Mac and Windows have completely different ways for handling drag-and-drop, 
        so a second platform-specific split must occur.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Realpolitik begins 
        the action in the file Main.cpp. This contains the main startup routine 
        (either main() or WinMain()) as well as the main event loop. There are 
        also a number of platform-dependant globals defined here. The main startup 
        routine begins by doing some platform-dependant initializations, then 
        calls the routine InitializeCommon(), found in Initialize.cpp. This does 
        some basic setup for Realpolitik: loading preferences, allocating memory 
        for data structures, loading the list of variants, and creating the text 
        windows. If this succeeds, Realpolitik moves on to either creating a new 
        game or loading one from drag-and-drop.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Macintosh drag-and-drop 
        works by sending an AppleEvent event to the application. So Mac Realpolitik 
        finishes calling InitializeCommon() and drops right into the main event 
        loop. The AppleEvent is caught (in EventUtil.cpp), and the appropriate 
        routine, either InitNewGame() or OpenFinderGame() is called.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Windows drag-and-drop 
        works by putting a file name in the cmdline for the application. If there 
        is a filename there, Realpolitik calls OpenFinderGame(). Otherwise it 
        calls InitNewGame(). Only then is the main event loop started up.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">InitNewGame() and 
        OpenFinderGame() are pretty similar (in fact, in writing this document 
        I realized that InitNewGame() should really just call OpenFinderGame(), 
        using the .gam file for the variant). InitNewGame() works by setting the 
        current variant to the last one used, initializing the map window (which 
        also loads the map data for the variant) and then creating a new game, 
        which reads the information from the .gam file. OpenFinderGame() opens 
        the given file, sets the variant based on the file info, and then does 
        the same initialization of the map window and loading game information, 
        but this time from the .dpy file.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When either InitNewGame() 
        or OpenFinderGame() are done, control returns to the main event loop, 
        and Realpolitk is ready to use.</font></p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Movement Resolution 
        Algorithm</font></p>
      </font></b> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As mentioned before, 
        the resolution algorithm in Realpolitik is some of the oldest code in 
        the program. It runs off of a directed graph data structure into which 
        orders are added. Probably at some point this should be made into a C++ 
        class, but I wasn&#146;t eager to do something that might break the code 
        for this release. Because of its obtuse nature this code is also fairly 
        well commented. Note that this algorithm attempts to be as true to the 
        spirit of the Avalon Hill/Hasbro rules as possible, so you can have multiple 
        convoys for a single unit.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The first stage in 
        resolution is adding orders to the graph. First (unless Overwrite Units 
        is set) all the units are added to the graph and assumed to hold. Then 
        each order is added. Orders can be rejected through simple tests at this 
        point &#151; for instance, there is no unit at that location, or support 
        is provided to a space that the unit can&#146;t reach, or a unit is moving 
        to a space that it can&#146;t reach and it&#146;s not being convoyed, 
        etc. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To test if a army 
        can be convoyed to a space it can&#146;t normally get to, Realpolitik 
        uses a depth-first search, using the starting and ending spaces for the 
        army, and any convoying fleets that match the order. Note that this does 
        not find the shortest path &#151; it merely guarantees that there is a 
        path.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Once all the orders 
        have been added to the graph, the algorithm begins. The first step is 
        to check for cut supports. Because of the oddness of convoyed units and 
        dislodged fleets, this happens in a series of stages:</font></p>
      <ol>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Cut all supports 
          using non-convoyed units</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mark convoys that 
          could be dislodged as dubious</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mark convoyed armies 
          by those convoys as dubious</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Cut supports from 
          convoyed armies that are guaranteed to get there</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Clear the &#145;dubious&#146; 
          marks</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Perform any dislodges 
          on convoys</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mark convoyed armies 
          by those convoys as failed</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Cut any remaining 
          supports by convoyed armies</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Finally, cut any 
          supports against a stronger attacker</font></li>
      </ol>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The basic idea is 
        that first we cut supports by all moves that we know will get there, then 
        dislodge any convoying fleets, then cut via any remaining moves.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The next step is to 
        check moves that have supports from one country that may dislodge a unit 
        of the same country. This will clear those supports, or just enough to 
        bounce an opposing force, not to dislodge.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The next step is to 
        check all other move orders. This is done using a routine called follow(). 
        The concept is that we see if a move succeeds by following its path through 
        the graph. This may depend on another move succeeding (i.e. moving out 
        of the way) so we follow that move. And so on, until either a move definitely 
        succeeds or fails, or we end up with a cycle, in which case all moves 
        succeed.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The stages in the 
        follow function are:</font></p>
      <ol>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Make sure this 
          is a non-resolved move order</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If there&#146;s 
          a cycle, return failure if you&#146;re trying to switch with your neighbor 
          (unless one of you is convoyed), otherwise return success</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If your destination 
          is moving towards you and has greater support than you, mark as failed 
          and return (assuming neither of you are convoyed).</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If you are not 
          the strongest unit vying for the destination, return failure</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If there&#146;s 
          no unit there, mark success and return</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If there is a unit 
          and it moves (test by calling follow() for that unit), mark success 
          and return</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Remove any supports 
          for this move that would lead to a self-dislodge (rule IX.3)</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If we&#146;re still 
          stronger in support than our destination and we wouldn&#146;t self-dislodge, 
          then mark success and return.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If we&#146;re still 
          stronger in support then our destination and we would self-dislodge, 
          return failure</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Otherwise mark 
          failed and return.</font></li>
      </ol>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Note a couple of fine 
        points. There is a difference between marking a move as failed, and returning 
        failure. Marking a move as failure means that it will not succeed under 
        any circumstances. Returning failure without marking it means that it 
        won&#146;t succeed, but it may be used to bounce another move. Also note 
        that areas where bounces occur are marked so that they will be unavailable 
        for retreats.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The final step of 
        resolution is to check for self-dislodges. Any move that would dislodge 
        a unit of the same country automatically fails. This is done after the 
        main follow algorithm so that self-dislodges can still be used to bounce 
        enemy moves.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The remainder is just 
        clean-up: adding dislodged units to the dislodge list, and copying the 
        resolution from the graph back to the order.</font></p>
      <b><font size=2 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
      <p>Retreat and Adjustment Resolution</p>
      </font></b> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Retreats are resolved 
        very simply. First check that the unit can retreat to the space it&#146;s 
        retreating to, and then add to the graph like a normal move order. Any 
        bounces are changed to disbands. Any retreating unit that has no order 
        is automatically disbanded.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Adjustments are also 
        pretty simple. They need to be added to the graph to check for duplicate 
        orders and set up things for civil disorder, but then it&#146;s just a 
        case of going through order by order and making sure that there aren&#146;t 
        too many builds or removals for a particular country. The one wrinkle 
        is when a country has given to few removals &#151; in this case civil 
        disorder takes over and units are automatically removed. This is done 
        using a breadth-first search to determine the distance between the country&#146;s 
        home centers and each of the country&#146;s units. Armies are slightly 
        different in that sea spaces with fleets are included in the search, since 
        they can be used to convoy the armies.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As mentioned above, 
        this document is not nearly complete. The problem is that the time I spend 
        writing documentation, is time where others don&#146;t have access to 
        code &#151; so I&#146;m releasing it in this unfinished state and hope 
        the code, such as it is, will speak for itself until I have a chance to 
        finish writing. Until then, here are some miscellaneous notes on some 
        of the trickier bits of code.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">InitMapDisplay() calls 
        ReadMapData() and LoadInfoText(). I&#146;m sure there was a historical 
        reason for this (I blame the Gauls), but the reason I left it is because 
        every time I&#146;m loading a new variant I want to initialize the map 
        window, then read map data, then the info text. This would probably be 
        better wrapped in a differently named initialization routine.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Spaces on the map 
        are called sectors in the code. I once mis-heard supply <i>centers</i> 
        as supply <i>sectors</i>, so thought all the spaces were called sectors, 
        and the term stuck. The Judge calls them provinces, which I think is a 
        better name. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Certain &quot;classes&quot;, 
        such as Unit and Neighbor, are stored in linked lists. Creating and destroying 
        these lists was taking up a lot of time, so I pre-allocate memory for 
        them. If a variant is particularly large, you can run out of pre-allocated 
        data, which could cause problems. Similarly, there are a maximum number 
        of spaces and players, which are set in MapData.h.</font></p>

      <p>Mac Carbon Build Notes</p>
      </font></b> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We now have a Carbon build.
      For CodeWarrior 7, there are several targets. MachO only runs on OS X, and CFM is for 
      Carbon on OS9. The reason we build MachO and CFM is so we can easily use OSX features such as
      Services and CoreGraphics (for antialiased text and graphics).
      The full-package target is "Carbon Final CFM/MachO" which builds both 
      binaries into a single bundled application, the structure of which looks like:
      <pre>
      Realpolitik.app/
      Realpolitik.app/Realpolitik (alias to the CFM executable, for OS8.6)
      Realpolitik.app/Contents/     
      Realpolitik.app/Contents/MacOS/Realpolitik   (this is the MachO executable)
      Realpolitik.app/Contents/MacOSClassic/Realpolitik (this is the CFM executable)
      Realpolitik.app/Contents/Resources/Icons       
      Realpolitik.app/Contents/Resources/Realpolitik.rsrc (flattened resource fork)             
      Realpolitik.app/Contents/Resources/1898            
      Realpolitik.app/Contents/Resources/Standard, etc (variant folders)  
      </pre>      
      This bundling system is explained in "Inside Mac OS X: System Overview".
      <p> The Carbon build expects the variant folders to be in the bundle with the application, in 
      the Resources directory. If you build with Project Builder, it will be copied in automatically.
	  CodeWarrior does not copy the files, so you should copy all the folders from "Variant Files"
	  into the Realpolitik.app/Contents/Resources/ folder. Or simply build once with PB - it will copy them
	  for you and they will stay there until you delete them. However you need to tell PB to build into /output. (see below)
	   </p>
	  <p>
	  Realpolitik builds and runs fine in Project Builder, but PB can only build the MachO executable.
	  Currently PB 1.1 seems to have problems with relative paths (../output) to an output directory, and will 
	  build into a folder called "build" in the same directory as the project. To work around this,
	  make a symlink (ln -s) to the "output" directory called "build" in the same folder as the project.
	  Alternatively, you could specify an absolute path to the output directory as the build location.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  After building the final MachO build you should run the "strip" command in terminal on the executable. 
	  Even for the final target, CW and PB do not strip everything. After the strip command the MachO binary size is less than 270k.
	  Also any xSYM files generated by codewarrior for debug builds can be deleted.
